Hello
I use next.js to display posts on my site.
The name of my site is raiatec.com, and it reads the post data from the WordPress site raiatec.ir through api.
I want to Add a Dynamic Sitemap to Next.js Website Using Pages Directory to improve SEO.


I have done the following:
1- In WordPress, I have set the permalink to the post name. It means that the name of the post title is shown in the URL.
2- I have installed the next.js program on the localhost of my computer, which works correctly.
3- Using the useApi.js file, I read the post information from the api:

// api/useApi.js
import useSWR from "swr";

const fetcher = (url) => fetch(url).then((res) => res.json());
const API_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;

export function usePosts() {
    const apiUrl = `${API_URL}/posts?per_page=100&_embed`;
    const {data, error} = useSWR(apiUrl, fetcher);
    return {
        posts: data,
        isLoading: !error && !data,
        isError: error
    };
}

4- My .env.local file is as follows:
// .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://raiatec.ir/wp-json/wp/v2

Please write the pages/sitemap.xml.js file for me to generate the sitemap for me.
Thanks
