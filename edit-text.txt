I have a next.js site and I use the lighthouse in Chrome browser's dev tools to test its performance.
After running analyze in the mobile section, I received the following message for the text of a paragraph:
"
This is the largest contentful element painted within the viewport.
"
What is the problem with my font or text and how should I fix it?
The font I use is as follows:

// src/global.css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@font-face {
    font-family: IRANSansXV;
    src: url('../fonts/IRANSansXV.woff') format('woff-variations'),
        /* will be the standard and works in Safari now */ url('../fonts/IRANSansXV.woff') format('woff');
    /* for the other supporting browsers */
    font-weight: 100 900;
    font-display: fallback;

}
