I have a headless WordPress site, the front end is with next.js and the back end is with WordPress.
I want to show a list of post titles on my site.
The WordPress API provides posts with pagination, that is, it provides 10 posts per page by default, and by adding per_page=100&_embed to the endpoint, the maximum limit can be increased to 100 posts.
But I don't want to get my posts with pagination, instead I want to load posts with infinite scroll feature.
In other words, I want to cancel the pagination related to the WordPress api and scroll down, all the post titles of my site will be loaded.
To implement infinite scrolling, I want to use the react-window library and I have done the following:

1- I have written the .env.local file as follows:
// .env.local
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://raiatec.ir/wp-json/wp/v2

2- I have written the useApi.js file to fetch the post titles as follows:
// api/useApi.js
import useSWR from "swr";

const fetcher = (url) => fetch(url).then((res) => res.json());
const API_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;

export function usePosts() {
    const apiUrl = `${API_URL}/posts`;
    const {data, error} = useSWR(apiUrl, fetcher);
    return {
        posts: data,
        isLoading: !error && !data,
        isError: error
    };
}

3- I have installed react-window.
