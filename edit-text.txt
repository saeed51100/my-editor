I have a headless WordPress site, the front end is with next.js and the back end is with WordPress.
I want to show a list of post titles on my site.
I have done the following:
1- I have written the .env.local file as follows:
// .env.local
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://raiatec.ir/wp-json/wp/v2

2- The api/useApi.js file is as follows:
// api/useApi.js
import useSWR from "swr";

const fetcher = (url) => fetch(url).then((res) => res.json());
const API_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;

// Function to fetch post titles
export function usePosts() {
     const apiUrl = `${API_URL}/posts?per_page=100&_embed`;
     const {data, error} = useSWR(apiUrl, fetcher);
     return {
         posts: data,
         isLoading: !error && !data,
         isError: error
     };
}

3- The components/list-of-post.jsx file is as follows:
// components/list-of-posts.jsx
import {usePosts} from "api/useApi";

export default function ListOfPost() {
     const {posts} = usePosts();

     return (
         <div>
             {posts.map((post) => (
                 <p key={post.id}>
                     {post.title.rendered}
                 </p>
             ))}
         </div>
     );
}

4- I have installed swr and react-intersection-observer and tailwindcss libraries.

The program works correctly and shows the list of post titles.
But I don't want all the post titles to load at once, instead I want to use the infinite scroll feature. That is, at first, a certain number of, for example, 10 post titles should be loaded, and then when the user scrolls down, more posts should be loaded.
Please write the code for me using the react-intersection-observer library, swr library and tailwindcss classes.
